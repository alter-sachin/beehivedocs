Considering the need of science and religion to work together to truly reap the benefits of democracy. This shall be a corner where i write all thoughts on how this could be acheived
My aim would be to make things as easy to understand while not missing out on the details.

Science vs religion: 
The main reason for science to flourish has been one aspect : Uncertainity. Religious texts promote certainity of thought, certainly
because of reasons to control the surroundings. Man in his quest for meaning craves certainity. Men of science of the
contrary conclude that this certainity once acheived (if ever) would mean the failure of science.
Science involves questioning, argumetation , experimentation to conclude facts that can only survive one experiment that disporves 
a scienctific theory. Religion on the other hand comes up with ways for experimenaion of a set dogma of values and culture

The cumulation of a scientific religion requires an incremental change where uncertainity that science promotes (coming up with certain outcomes in the process)
joins hand with uncertainity of truth in religious beliefs. Intersection is important for large sides to see unity in human culture.

More importantly, if beehive believes in being social messengers of progressive thought. Subtle expression of the same is necessary.

"The typical human problem, and one whose answer religion aims to supply, is always of the following form: Should I do this? Should we do this? Should the government do this? To answer this question we can resolve it into two parts: First — If I do this, what will happen? — and second — Do I want that to happen? What would come of it of value — of good?

Now a question of the form: If I do this, what will happen? is strictly scientific. As a matter of fact, science can be defined as a method for, and a body of information obtained by, trying to answer only questions which can be put into the form: If I do this, what will happen? The technique of it, fundamentally, is: Try it and see. Then you put together a large amount of information from such experiences. All scientists will agree that a question — any question, philosophical or other — which cannot be put into the form that can be tested by experiment … is not a scientific question; it is outside the realm of science.

I claim that whether you want something to happen or not — what value there is in the result, and how you judge the value of the result (which is the other end of the question: Should I do this?), must lie outside of science because it is not a question that you can answer only by knowing what happens; you still have to judge what happens — in a moral way. So, for this theoretical reason I think that there is a complete consistency between the moral view — or the ethical aspect of religion — and scientific information."
