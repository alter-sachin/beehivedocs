The romance culture: 
Another idea for later or sooner if we get to being an effective team.
An app where ex's from their social media accounts login to have this one last talk of resolution where both parties have agreed 
this could be done.
The idea is, when any relationship goes bad, it is not necessary that it is a mutual decision. And one of the parties is left  with
no clue and lament their situation. which can go on for days and days . We solve the problem by making a platform for the same, where
the "match-ups" are decided by both parties involved. 
We could make this fun, serious. But the recent inflation of people wanting to fall in love is a drastic one. Especially college students.In india.
I call this judge me.
